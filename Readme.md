<!-- Overview -->
## Overview

During my time at McKinsey & Coompany, I deilvered value through improvements and added funcitonality in existing McKinsey codebases. This document is a broad overview of my contributions to the firm's services without revealing any propietary information. 

Because of the sensitive nature of the Firm's codebases and the restrictions placed on us being Firm members, I will avoid using any code snippets and rely just on explanation.

### Technical Projects

Abraham - I maintain a centralized location for my personal technical projects on my GitHub profile. This is where you can find my code repositories, along with the technical work that I have completed during my apprenticeship with Multiverse and McKinsey and Company. All of these projects have been designed to meet the technical criteria established by the Department of Labor (DOL), ensuring that they meet the highest standards in terms of technical proficiency and quality. By reviewing my projects on my GitHub profile, you can gain a comprehensive understanding of my technical capabilities and evaluate my proficiency in the field. Additionally, you can also access the technical folder of my projects with Multiverse and McKinsey and Company to view more of my work.
